## Visualization Guidelines

**Chart Types:**
- Timeline: Line charts for trend analysis (daily/weekly patterns)
- Comparison: Grouped bar charts for person-to-person analysis
- Distribution: Heatmap calendar view for pattern detection
- Summary: Donut charts for yearly breakdown

**Chart Styling:**
- Grid lines: subtle (rgba(255,255,255,0.05))
- Tooltips: dark surface with white text
- Legend: horizontal, top-aligned
- Animations: smooth transitions (300ms ease)

## Page Structure

1. **Header Bar** - App title, current file name, re-upload button
2. **Upload Section** (when no file loaded) - Hero-style centered upload zone
3. **Overview Dashboard** - 3-column grid of person cards with quick stats
4. **Insights Panel** - Auto-detected patterns in horizontal scrollable cards
5. **Detailed Charts Section** - Stacked chart containers with period toggles
6. **Data Explorer** - Tabular view with filters and sorting

## Images

**No hero images required.** This is a data-focused application where visualizations (charts, graphs) serve as the primary visual elements. All imagery is data-driven through Chart.js renderings.

**Icons:** Use Heroicons via CDN for all UI icons (upload, calendar, trending, users, chart-bar).
